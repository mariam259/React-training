# E-commerce Application

This project is an e-commerce application I developed at the end of my internship. It showcases my frontend development skills using React.js, Redux, and Tailwind CSS.

**Key Features:**

* **User Authentication:** Includes user registration and login functionalities.
* **Product Catalog:** Displays a list of shopping items with detailed information (name, price, description, images).
* **Shopping Cart:** Allows users to add products to their cart, view cart contents, and update quantities.
* **Responsive Design:** Built using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile).
* **State Management:** Utilizes Redux to manage application state, such as user authentication status, shopping cart items, and other relevant data.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Frontend:** React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, React Icons
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **State Management:** Redux

**Project Structure:**

* **Components:** Contains reusable UI components for various parts of the application (e.g., ItemDetails, Navbar, CartItem).
* **Pages:** Contains components for different application pages (e.g., Home, ProductList, ProductDetail, Cart, Login, Signup).
* **Store:** Contains Redux store, reducers, and actions for managing application state.


**Running the application:**

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Gained practical experience in building a complex React.js application.
* Developed a strong understanding of Redux for managing application state effectively.
* Learned to implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
* Improved my skills in component-based architecture and code reusability.
* Enhanced my understanding of best practices in frontend development.
